# shiny_Notes
A shiny application for taking notes in a hierarchical fashion with a key feature of being able to link notes to each other and open notes as children of other notes.

How to use the application:

1. Download and run the app like any other Shiny application

2. Enter a note title and note text and hit create note to create your first note

3. Within the text of a note, you can reference another note (even an uncreated one) by wrapping the text in {}.

4. Once you've created your first note, it should show up on the Index Note in the bottom left. Click on it to open it on the noteboard.

5. Once in the noteboard, you can click on any referenced notes to open them as child notes.

6. Create as many notes as you need and open them across the noteboard!

7. Double clicking on a title or notetext will allow you to live edit it.
